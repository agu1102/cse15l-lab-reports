For taking the course of CSE15L, it is essential for you to know how to log into your course-specific account(ieng6).
The first step is setting up your CSE15L account. It has been already created to your school account as a additional account. By log into https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php using your school account, you can check your specific ETS account associated with your student ID. To reset your password, follow the exact steps in the tutorial https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit.
The second step is installing VScode in your computer. The download website for Visual Studio Code is https://code.visualstudio.com/ and follow the instructions to install the correct version of it depending on your computer operating system. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122497644/212789872-37c5bc7e-b632-4b25-a4a2-c0a1cbd7c6a3.png)
